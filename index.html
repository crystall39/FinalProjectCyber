                <h3> Dear Agent,</h3>
                <h3> We have just received word that one of
                    our other agents obtained the username
                    and password of a member of a local gang
                    here in the New York Area. This website
                    seems to be how they send messages and
                    codes to each other. However, it seems
                    that the username and password are encrypted
                    in some way and we can't figure out how to
                    decrypt it.
                </h3>
                <h3> I heard you're well-versed in cryptography.
                     Think you can help us out here?
